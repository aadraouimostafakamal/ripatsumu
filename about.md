I‚Äôm **Mostafa-Kamal Aadraoui**, a cybersecurity engineering student at ENSAO with a deep interest in offensive security. I explore and build in areas like web and API penetration testing, Active Directory attacks, mobile app security, and federated learning systems. Whether I‚Äôm diving into machine learning for malware detection or building custom security tools, I aim to understand and challenge the technologies that shape our digital world.

Currently, I‚Äôm sharpening my skills through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and real-world penetration testing labs. I‚Äôve ranked in the **top 2% on TryHackMe**, placed **2nd in the ENSAO CTF**.

My offensive work is paired with a solid foundation in networking, cryptography, and secure system design‚Äîhoned through internships in system administration and secure backend development.
